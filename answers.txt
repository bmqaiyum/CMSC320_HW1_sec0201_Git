Q1: Why might we consider using Git?
Answer: We should use git because it allows version control and tracking history. This allows you to go back to previous versions of whatever you were working on if you made a mistake, or for whatever other reason. It also allows for collaboration. Multiple people can work on one project at the same time. Once everybody has made their changes, their changes can be merged back into the main tree. Everybody can see these changes. It is also very fast; Committing, merging, and pulling are all very fast operations despite the size of the project

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an example.
Data science could apply to any field because every field works with data, and data science is all about working with data and analyzing that data to make findings. An example would be the healthcare field where you can analyze data of certain drugs and their efficacy.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?
Merging combines the histories of two branches by creating a new merge commit. Rebasing moves the commits of one branch on top of another. Merging preserves history, but rebasing rewrites it.
