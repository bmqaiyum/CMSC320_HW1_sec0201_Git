Q1: Why might we consider using Git?
Answer: We should use git because it allows version control and tracking history. This allows you to go back to previous versions of whatever you were working on if you made a mistake, or for whatever other reason. It also allows for collaboration. Multiple people can work on one project at the same time. Once everybody has made their changes, their changes can be merged back into the main tree. Everybody can see these changes. It is also very fast; Committing, merging, and pulling are all very fast operations despite how big the projects may be.
